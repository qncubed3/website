<h2>Update your CAS OS</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
    It is best to keep your CAS up to date on the latest operating system (OS) version to avoid any issues using the UDFs. 
    Your OS version can be found from the home page by going to Settings [5] then Status [4].
    To update your CAS, you'll need a CAS cable that is able to be connected to a PC.

<div class="paragraph">1. Is your CAS charging after plugging it into your PC? If not, your cable may be faulty and you'll need to find a replacement.</div>
<div class="paragraph">2. There have been instances where a Mac does not recognise a CAS. Try a windows PC or another PC.</div>
<div class="paragraph">3. If you don't have any other options, you can ask your tutor after class for assistance.</div>
